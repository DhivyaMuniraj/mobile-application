/**
 * Selection sort is an inefficient* primitive sorting algorithm.
 * Principle:
 *      Go through the list and find the smallest element in the list. After it was found,
 *      swap the element with the element on Nth place in the list, where N is the number of iterations that
 *      was already done.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(n^2) in all cases.
 * Space complexity: O(1) for the original list.
